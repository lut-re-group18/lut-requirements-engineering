### 3.1 Change management

In this section, the change management process and tools used in the project are described.

#### 3.1.1 Version management
Change management and the process to update this document is based on version control system Git. The document is stored in the repository and the changes are tracked in the version history. The document is updated by the requirements engineering team and the changes are approved using pull requests. Required pull request reviewer is a role defined in the chapter [2.1 Organization, responsibilities, interfaces](#21-organization-responsibilities-interfaces).

This and other project documentation can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joniturunen/lut-requirements-engineering) in markdown language. Document table of contents is generated and updated (automatically) in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) using [markdown extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one).

Docs are available for public access and do not inlcude personal information. Deliverables for the course are generated in PDF format with tools like [pandoc](https://github.com/pandoc/pandoc-action-example) and [heredoc](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) in [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). 

#### 3.1.2 Change management process

> Describe the process by which problems and changes are submitted, reviewed, and resolved. This should include the process for negotiating requirements changes with customers, and any contractual processes, activities, and constraints. Describe the membership of the Change Control Board (CCB) and procedures for processing change requests and approvals to be followed by the CCB.

TODO: Decide how to handle changes to the requirements.

- Maybe we can use GitHub issues to track changes and use pull requests to approve them?
